it
it comes hard on him
it does not amount to a row of beans (pins)
it doesn't grow on every hedge
it doesn't matter a farthing
it feels like rain
it fell out that
it goes without saying
it heaps years on me
it is a long lane that has no turning
it is as broad as it is long
it is long since I heard of him
it is no class
it is no laughing matter
it is no sin for a man to labour in his vocation
it is no use crying over spilt milk
it is not the case
it is not the coat that makes the gentlemen
it is now borne in upon me that...
it is on the knees of the gods
it is raining in earnest
it is six of one and half a dozen of the other
it is something to be safe home again
it is that
it is the last straw that breaks the camel's back
it isn't done!
it makes a great difference
it makes no odds
it never rains but it pours
it rains cats and dogs
it rains pitchfork
it serves him right!
it stands to reason that...
it sticks in my craw
it takes two to do something
it will go hard with him
it'd
it'll
it's
it's (that's) all very well but...
it's a small world
it's all in the day's work
it's all over with him
it's all up with him
it's an ill bird that fouls its own nest
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it's black tie
it's daylight robbery!
it's domino with somebody
it's fine for young ducks
it's Greek to me
it's never too late to mend
it's no go
it's not someone's day
it's not worth a farthing
it's only to true
it's our baby
it's ten to one that he won't come
it/things warm for somebody
